# Snus-Collection-App
My app for keeping track of what brands of Snus I have tested


In this project I have used and learned about constraintlayouts, MVVM architecture, navigation graphs, 
android lifecycles and much more. With the usage of ViewModels the app will survive configuration changes 
and while maintaining proper encapsulation. The apps UX theme is a funny take on the Swedish habit 
of "snus" and the collection of ones "snus's".
